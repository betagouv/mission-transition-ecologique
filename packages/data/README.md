# DATA FOLDER FOR TEE PROJECT

This workspace aims to be a space where we could store the raw data (as yaml files) and make basic operations on these primary data, such as build a json file compiling every yaml file.

## Install dependencies

```sh
# From this folder
nvm use
npm install
```

Or

```sh
# From root folder
nvm use
npm install --workspace packages/data
```

## Run the scripts

### Build JSON output

npm run build-front-json-output-watch
